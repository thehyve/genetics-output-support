# Open Targets: Genetics-output-support overview

Genetics Output Support (POS) is the third component in the back-end data and infrastructure generation pipeline.
GOS is an automatic and unified place to perform a release of OT Platform to the public. The other two components are Platform Input Support (GIS) and the ETL.
POS will be responsible for:

* Infrastructure tasks (todo)
* Publishing datasets in different services
* Data validation (todo)

### Requirement
*) Terraform
*) Jq

### How to run the different steps
Simply run the following command:

```make```

The output shows the possible action to run

```
Usage:
  make
  help             show help message
  bigquerydev      Big Query Dev
  bigqueryprod     Big Query Production
```

Every single variables is stored in the **config.tfvars**

The current POS steps are:

```make bigquerydev``` it generates a bigquery dataset in eu-dev

```make bigqueryprod``` it generates a bigquery dataset in production
